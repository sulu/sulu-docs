Creating a basic website
========================

In :doc:`../getting-started/index` we got Sulu running. Now it is time to create a website.
We'll have another look at the Sulu content architecture and afterwords work through
the process of building a website. We'll define webspaces and templates, add a theme, 
write twig templates and get a little bit into smart content and localization.

and afterwards will create stuff.
