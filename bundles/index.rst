Bundles
=======

The Sulu code is structured in Symfony Bundles. Some of them are more important
to developers who work with Sulu than others. In this documentation we
documented the most important ones.

**We documented the following bundles**

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    audience_targeting
    category
    contact
    custom_url
    hash
    http_cache
    location
    markup/index
    media/index
    page/index
    persistence
    preview/index
    route/index
    search
    security
    snippet
    tag
    website/index

When you get in touch with another bundle of Sulu, which is not documented in
this place. Tell us. We'll provide the documentation.
