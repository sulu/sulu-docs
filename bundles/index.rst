Bundles
=======

The Sulu code is structured in Symfony Bundles. Some of them are more important
to developers who work with Sulu than others. In this documentation we
documented the most important ones.

**We documented the following bundles**

.. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2

     admin/index
     content
     media

When you get in touch with another bundle of Sulu, which is not documented in
this place. Tell us. We'll provide the documentation.
