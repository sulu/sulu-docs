Bundles
=======

The Sulu code is structured in Symfony Bundles. Some of them are more important
to developers who work with Sulu than others. In this documentation we
documented the most important ones.

**We documented the following bundles**

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    activity
    audience_targeting
    category
    contact
    custom_url
    hash

    preview/index
    route/index
    search
    security
    snippet
