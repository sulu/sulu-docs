Bundles
=======

The Sulu code is structured in Symfony Bundles. Some of them are more important
to developers who work with Sulu than others. In this documentation we
documented the most important ones.

**We documented the following bundles**

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    admin/index
    audience_targeting
    automation/index
    collaboration
    content/index
    hash
    http_cache
    markup/index
    media
    persistence
    preview/index
    route/index
    search
    security
    website/index

When you get in touch with another bundle of Sulu, which is not documented in
this place. Tell us. We'll provide the documentation.
