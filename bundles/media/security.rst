Security
========

Separate permissions can be applied to every collection. These permissions also
apply to the assets contained in the collection.

So the `view` permission is required to see the collection itself in the
navigation and its assets in any available view in the system.

The `add` permission is needed to upload new assets and add new subcollections
to a collection. With the `edit` permission the user is allowed to edit the
title and other attributes of the collections and its containing assets, and
finally the `delete` permission is required to delete assets and entire
collections.
